 * <p>A goal-accepting reasoner provides the following:

 *
 * <li>an interface that provides an optional instruction to this reasoner to
 * try and reconstruct the transformation that produced the new goal, and</li>
 *
 * <li>an interface that optionally enables passing prover-specific proof traces
 * that come with the new goals (useful for proof reconstruction).</li>
