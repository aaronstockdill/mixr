/**
 * Goal-transforming reasoners have the basic ability to take {@link Goals goals},
 * {@link Goal a particular goal}, {@link Formula a particular formula} within
 * the goal, or even {@link FormulaRepresentation a particular representation of
 * a formula}, optionally let the user interactively apply some inference rules
 * on it, and then commit the changed goals back to the original reasoner
 * through {@link GoalsManager the goals manager}.
 *
 * <p>The changed goal must logically entail the original one. Also, the
 * reasoner must explicitly tell which goals were changed. All the changed goals
 * will be replaced by the new ones.</p>
 *
 * <p>The changed goal may optionally come with a proof trace, which can be
 * reconstructed in the receiving {@link GoalAcceptingReasoner goal-accepting
 * reasoner}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is a list of possible scenarios of how the user may apply inference
 * rules in Diabelli:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>The user picks a single {@link InferenceTarget inference target} and
 * invokes a reasoner to work with it.</li>
 *
 * <li>The user picks multiple inference targets and invokes a reasoner to work
 * with it. Not all combinations of inference targets are allowed. For example,
 * the user may select only multiple goals or multiple premises and a conclusion
 * from a single goal.</li>
 *
