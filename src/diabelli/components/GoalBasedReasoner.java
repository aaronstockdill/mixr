/**
 * Goal-based reasoners are all interactive reasoners that fulfil the following
 * requirements: <ul> <li>a list of goals to be proved should be provided
 * (these goals may be provided to the Diabelli framework in whatever format,
 * but the format should preferably be understandable by other Diabelli
 * components, which could then present these goals diagrammatically for
 * example),</li> <li>the goals should contain premises and a conclusion (a goal
 * is proved if the premises entail the conclusion trivially), and</li> <li>if
 * the list of goals changes, Diabelli should be notified of it (through
 * events).</li> </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Note that a goal-based reasoner alone does not have to accept changed
 * goals from other components. Goal-based reasoners can use the Diabelli
 * framework merely for displaying goals in other ways (diagrammatic, for example)
 * or exporting them to other components. Reasoners that accept changed goals
 * are of the type {@link GoalAcceptingReasoner}.</p>
