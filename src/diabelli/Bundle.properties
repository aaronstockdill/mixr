OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Diabelli provides a way to connect various sentential and diagrammatic theorem provers into one heterogeneous framework.\n\n\
    Diabelli's main functionality is illustrated by the following use-case example:\n\n1.) \
    A user sets on to prove a theorem in a theorem prover A that has support in Diabelli.\n\n2.) \
    The user's proof obligations are constantly being passed on to Diabelli, which in turn passes these goals on to other supported reasoners and goal presenters.\n\n3.) \
    Somewhere in the proof, a number of presenters are able to produce diagrammatic representations of the user's goals (or a part of their goals). \
    The user can instruct Diabelli to visualise these representations, which they then inspect for better insight.\n\n4.) \
    Somewhere in the proof, a number of other reasoners report that they are able to reason with the user's goals (or a part of their goals). \
    The user can instruct Diabelli to apply an inference step on their goals using one of the other reasoners. \
    After the step has been performed, the transformed goal is passed back to the original prover A.
