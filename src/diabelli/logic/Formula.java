/**
 * Represents a general formula. It can be a diagrammatic, sentential, or both
 * at the same time (if the {@link GoalProvidingReasoner reasoner} provides more
 * than one representation of this formula). This class can thus carry many
 * representations, or formats, of the same formula. For example, a formula
 * can be represented with many strings (using syntaxes of many theorem provers),
 * with term trees (abstract syntax trees), or similar. However, there is always
 * {@link Formula#getMainRepresentation() one main representation}. Other
 * representations should be equivalent to it, or at least have the proper
 * logical relation to it (i.e., if this formula is {@link Goal#getPremises() a
 * premise}, then all other representations of it must be logically entailed by
 * the {@link Formula#getMainRepresentation() main representation}; on the other
 * hand, when the formula is {@link Goal#getConclusion() a conclusion}, then the
 * other direction of entailment must hold; the representations can be
 * logically equivalent, i.e., mutually entailed, which is always allowed).
