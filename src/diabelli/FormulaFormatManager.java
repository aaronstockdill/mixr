/**
 * Provides a central mechanism for registering known {@link
 * FormulaFormatDescriptor formula formats}. This provides a way for
 * identifying, translating, and understanding of {@link FormulaRepresentation formulae}
 * in different formats. Since Diabelli's main goal is to connect different
 * reasoners, all of which may understand different representations, this class
 * provides a solution for ease of translation between the reasoners.
 * <p>Formula formats are registered when {@link DiabelliComponent Diabelli components}
 * are loaded. The components which want to register new formula formats must 
 * implement the {@link FormulaFormatProvider} interface.</p>
